## Current Position
- **Phase**: 3 (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 3 executed precisely. `OpenAI`, `Twilio`, and `nodemailer` communication handlers were instantiated with protective fail-safes. The background scheduler now loops and directly pipes evaluation parameters (due dates and urgency tone) directly into the generative communication pipeline, simulating sent receipts for the demo hackathon app efficiently.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Phase 4: Conversation & Intent Handler (`/plan 4`).
