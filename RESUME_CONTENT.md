## Interview Talking Points

### 1. **AI Integration Challenge**
"I integrated Google Gemini AI with WhatsApp Business API to process customer orders via voice and text. The challenge was handling multiple languages and voice notes - I implemented automatic language detection and used Gemini's multimodal capabilities to transcribe and understand orders, then emit real-time updates to the merchant dashboard via Socket.io."

### 2. **OCR Implementation**
"I built an OCR feature using Tesseract.js that allows shopkeepers to simply photograph supplier bills. The system automatically extracts product names, quantities, and prices. The tricky part was handling varying bill formats - I trained the system with preprocessing techniques and fallback validation to ensure accuracy."

### 3. **Group Buying Feature**
"I created a collaborative purchasing platform where multiple retailers can pool orders to get bulk discounts. I implemented real-time progress bars showing how many participants joined, with confetti animations when deals unlock. Upon completion, participants get a digital gate pass with QR codes for truck arrival verification."

### 4. **Real-time Architecture**
"I used Socket.io to enable real-time features across the platform - from tracking WhatsApp orders on the dashboard to showing live progress on group deals. This required careful event management and state synchronization between frontend and backend."

### 5. **Offline-First Design**
"Using Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper), I built offline capabilities so shopkeepers can continue billing even without internet. Data syncs automatically when connection restores, ensuring zero downtime in rural areas with unstable connectivity."

## For Cover Letters / Detailed Descriptions

"KiranaLink represents my passion for building technology that solves real-world problems for underserved markets. Indian Kirana stores form the backbone of retail but lack digital tools. I built this platform to bridge that gap.

The project showcases my full-stack capabilities - from architecting scalable Node.js backends with MongoDB to crafting intuitive React frontends. I integrated cutting-edge AI (Google Gemini) for natural language processing, implemented OCR for document digitization, and built real-time features using Socket.io.

What I'm most proud of is the group buying feature - it creates a network effect where retailers collaborate to unlock better prices, demonstrating how technology can create community impact beyond individual users.

This project taught me to think beyond code - understanding user pain points (credit tracking through 'Khata'), designing for low-bandwidth environments (offline-first with IndexedDB), and building features that actually drive business value."
